Evaluation Criteria of
Cryptographic Algorithms

1. Level of security: An upper bound on the amount of
work necessary to defeat the objective.

2. Functionality: Is it most effective for a given objective?

3. Performance: Efficiency in terms of time, memory and
Storage usage

4. Ease of implementation: the complexity of

implementation in a software or hardware environment
