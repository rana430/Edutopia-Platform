security Objectives

2. Integrity : Assures that data (both stored and transmitted) are
accurate, consistent and changed only in an authorized manner.

= This covers two related concepts:

a) Data authenticity: verifies that data is genuine and originates
from a legitimate source without any unauthorized

modifications.
b) Nonrepudiation: Assures that:
— The sender of information is provided with proof of delivery

— the recipient is provided with proof of the sender’s identity

=> so neither can later deny having processed the information.

= Integrity ensures that data has not been changed, destroyed, or
lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner.
