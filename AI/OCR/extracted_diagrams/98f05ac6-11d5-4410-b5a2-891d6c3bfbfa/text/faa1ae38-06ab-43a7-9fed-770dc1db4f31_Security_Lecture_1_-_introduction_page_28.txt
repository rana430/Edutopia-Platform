Cryptographic Algorithms

Cryptographic Algorithms can also be categorized into:
1. Keyless : Do not use any keys during cryptographic
transformations.

2. Single-key : The result of a transformation is a
function of the input data and a single key, Known as
a secret key.

3. Two-key : Iwo different but related keys are used,
referred to as a private key and a public key.
