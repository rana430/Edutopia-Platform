Two-key Cryptographic
Algorithms

Digital signature algorithm

A digital signature is a value computed with a
cryptographic algorithm and associated with a data object
in such a way that any recipient of the data can use the
signature to verify the data’s origin and integrity

Alice

the signer of a data object uses sn se
the signer’s private key to

generate the signature

-O——

Alice's
private key

Anyone has the corresponding Bob
public key can verify that
validity of the signature.
