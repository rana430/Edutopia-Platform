Models For Evaluating Security

= Computational security: measures the amount of computational
effort required to defeat a system (e.g. AES-128 would take about
2.61*10' years to defeat)

= Anencryption scheme is said to be computationally secure if
either of the two criteria are met:

The cost of breaking the cipher exceeds the value of the
encrypted information.

The time required to break the cipher exceeds the useful
lifetime of the information.
