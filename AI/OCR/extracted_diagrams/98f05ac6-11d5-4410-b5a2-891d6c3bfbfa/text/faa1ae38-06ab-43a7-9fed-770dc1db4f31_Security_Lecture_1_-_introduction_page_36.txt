Two-key Cryptographic
Algorithms

= Two-key algorithms involve the use of two related keys (private key &
public key).

A private key is Known only to a single user or entity, whereas the
corresponding public key is made available to a number of users.

Encryption algorithms that use two keys are referred to as
asymmetric (public-key) encryption algorithms.
