Brute-Force attack

= Involves an exhaustive search of the key space.

# trying every possible key until an intelligible translation of
the ciphertext into plaintext is obtained.

= On average, half of all possible keys must be tried to
achieve SUCCESS.

= the number of keys (i.e., the size of the key space)
should be large enough to make this attack computationally
infeasible.
