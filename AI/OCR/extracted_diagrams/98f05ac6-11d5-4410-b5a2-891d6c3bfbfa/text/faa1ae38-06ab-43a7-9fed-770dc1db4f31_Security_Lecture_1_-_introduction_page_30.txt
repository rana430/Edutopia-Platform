Keyless Cryptographic
Algorithms

1. Cryptographic hash function: A function turns a
variable amount of text into a small, fixed-length
value called a hash value, hash code, or digest.

= Used to ensure data integrity

2. A pseudorandom number generator: produces a
deterministic sequence of numbers or bits that has
the appearance of being a truly random sequence.

= Used in key generation
