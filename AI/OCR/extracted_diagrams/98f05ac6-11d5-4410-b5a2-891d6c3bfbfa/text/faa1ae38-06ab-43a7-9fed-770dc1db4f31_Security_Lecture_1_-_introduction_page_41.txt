Cryptanalysis (Cryptanalytic
attacks)

Ciphertext-only attack (COA): The attacker tries to deduce the
decryption key or plaintext by only observing ciphertext.

Known-plaintext attack (KPA): The attacker has a set of plaintexts and
corresponding ciphertexts

Chosen-plaintext attack (CPA): The attacker chooses plaintext and is
then given corresponding ciphertext.

Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (ACPA) is a chosen-plaintext attack
wherein the choice of plaintext may depend on the previous requests.

Chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA): The attacker selects the ciphertext
and is then given the corresponding plaintext.

Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (ACCA) is a chosen-ciphertext attack
where the choice of ciphertext may depend on the previous requests.
