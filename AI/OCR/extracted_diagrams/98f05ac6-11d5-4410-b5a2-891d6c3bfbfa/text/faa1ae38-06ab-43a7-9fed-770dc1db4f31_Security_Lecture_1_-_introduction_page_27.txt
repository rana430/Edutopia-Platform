security Mechanisms

= No single mechanism can provide all services
= Common in most mechanisms: cryptographic algorithms.
= Cryptographic Algorithms can be broadly categorized into:

1. Reversible Cryptographic Algorithms: such as
encryption algorithms that allow data to be encrypted
and subsequently decrypted

2. Irreversible (one-way) Cryptographic Algorithms:
include hash algorithms and message authentication
codes, which are used in digital signature and message
authentication applications.
