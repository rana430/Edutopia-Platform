single-key Cryptographic
Algorithms

Another form of single-key cryptographic algorithm is the

message authentication code (MAC)

"A MAC Is a unique tag associated with a data block or
message to verify the integrity of the message.

= The MAC is generated using a secret key and a
cryptographic hash function of the message

= The recipient of the message can check if the calculated
MAC matches the MAC accompanying the message, this
provides assurance that the message has not been
altered
