Models For Evaluating Security

Unconditional security (perfect secrecy): Assumes that the
attacker must have unlimited computational resources to defeat
the system.

= the key must be at least as long as the message.

Complexity-theoretic security: worst-case analysis is used to
determine the computational power in terms of time and space
(e.g., polynomial, exponential, ...)

Provable security: A cryptographic method is said to be provably
secure If the difficulty of defeating it can be proven to be as difficult
as solving a well-known and difficult problem (e.g., integer
factorization)
