single-key Cryptographic
Algorithms

#" Encryption algorithms that use a single key are referred to as
symmetric encryption algorithms

# With symmetric encryption, an encryption algorithm takes as input
the data to be protected (plaintext) and a secret key and
produces a ciphertext.

=Â» Acorresponding decryption algorithm takes the ciphertext
(transformed data) and the same secret key and recovers the
original datz
