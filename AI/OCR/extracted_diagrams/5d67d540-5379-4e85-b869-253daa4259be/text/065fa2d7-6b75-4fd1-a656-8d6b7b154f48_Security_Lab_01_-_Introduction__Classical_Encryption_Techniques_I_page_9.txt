not hide the message itself.

All Entry Forms and Fees Forms should be ready
for final despatch to the Syndicate by Friday
2Oth or at the very latest, i'm told. by the 275%
Admin has improved here, though there's room
for improvement stil; just give us all two or three
more years and we'll really show you! Please
don't let these wretched 16+ proposals destroy
your basis O and A pattern Certainly this

would bring chaos.

Sincerely yours.
